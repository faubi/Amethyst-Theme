# Amethyst-Theme
Theme for gtk 3 apps
This is a simple theme for GTK 3 based on flat design and miminalism, with a color scheme of several shades of purple and pink.

To install on a linux desktop system, clone this repository to ~/.themes/Amethyst, and edit ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini to put Amethyst for the theme name. If your system has gui tools for managing themes then you can use that instead.
